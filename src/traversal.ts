/**
 * This file implements the traversal through www.footballsquads.co.uk, going all the way
 * from Country (e.g. eng) to a team in a season (e.g. Alaves/2018)
 * 
 * The way this traversal will work is via a plain bfs walk. We'll start with a list of countries
 * in the walk queue, then replace each of them with a league and a season, and in the last step
 * we'll add the team.
 * 
 * Once we are processing "team" nodes, we'll find players in each team and build a list of players
 * with all the teams they have been throughout the years.
